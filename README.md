# Medieval-Conquerors

Medieval Conquerors is a 2D Online PVP game created using Photon. In Medieval Conquerors, you can choose your Conqueror and get into a 1v1 fight with an enemy player.

The screenshots above are meant to showcase an online PVP match between my Unity Editor (on the left) and the latest build (on the right).
